# Mosaic API

Mosaic provides a powerful API for automating professional-grade video editing with AI-powered agents. Upload videos, run pre-built workflows, and receive polished outputs programmatically.

## Base URL

```text
https://api.usemosaic.ai
```

## Core Concepts

### Agent
A pre-built video editing workflow that can be executed via the API. Create and configure agents at [app.usemosaic.ai](https://app.usemosaic.ai).

### Agent Run
An execution instance of an agent that processes your videos. Track progress and retrieve outputs through the run ID.

### Video Upload
A 3-step process using pre-signed URLs for efficient, direct-to-cloud uploads.

### Triggers
Automated agent execution based on external events (e.g., new YouTube videos).
