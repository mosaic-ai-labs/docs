## GET /get-user-agents-simple

Return a lightweight list of **your own agents** – handy for populating dropdowns or showing recent creations in a UI.

| Query | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| limit | integer (1-100) | all | Caps the number of agents returned (newest first) |

Authentication is identical to other operational endpoints:
* Bearer API key (`mk_…`) or `X-API-Key` header
* Supabase session JWT for the Mosaic dashboard

### Example – list the five most-recent agents
```bash
curl -s "https://api.usemosaic.ai/api/get-user-agents-simple?limit=5" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSAIC_API_KEY"
```

### Response
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "agent-uuid",
      "name": "My Caption Preset",
      "description": "Animated captions in brand colours",
      "created_at": "2025-06-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

> The endpoint returns only **your** agents; there is no global marketplace yet. Results are sorted by `created_at` descending.

## POST /run-agent

Execute an agent workflow on an uploaded video file.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option A: Auto-select agent">
    Let Mosaic choose an agent based on your prompt:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.usemosaic.ai/api/run-agent" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "file_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",  # or youtube_<videoId>
        "prompt": "Generate a summary of the video"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option B: Specific agent">
    Target a specific agent by ID:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.usemosaic.ai/api/run-agent" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "agent_id": "22aa8e28-6178-4587-8cce-9d8cdb62a32c",
        "file_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",  # or youtube_<videoId>
        "auto": true
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| file_id | string (`uuid-v4` **or** `youtube_<videoId>`) | ✅ | Upload UUID **or** YouTube video ID prefixed with `youtube_` |
| agent_id | string (UUID) | ⚠️ | ID of the agent to run (mutually exclusive with `prompt`) |
| prompt | string | ⚠️ | Natural-language instruction; Mosaic picks an agent & parameters (mutually exclusive with `agent_id`) |
| parameters | object | | Key-value overrides for agent fields |
| auto | boolean | | Let Mosaic choose optimal parameters (only used with `agent_id`) |

<Note>
Use either `agent_id` OR `prompt`, not both. To process a public YouTube video without uploading, pass a `file_id` like `youtube_dQw4w9WgXcQ`.
</Note>

{
  "agent_run_id": "run_uuid",
  "project_id": "project_uuid",

| agent_run_node_id (path) | UUID | ✅ | ID of the node to retry. Must currently have `status=failed`. |
