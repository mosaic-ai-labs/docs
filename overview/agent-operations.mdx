## Overview

Agents are pre-built workflows that process your videos with AI-powered editing capabilities. Each agent is designed for specific tasks like generating captions, creating shorts, or enhancing audio.

### Creating Agents

First, create an agent on [app.mosaic.so](https://app.mosaic.so). Once created, you can find the agent ID in the URL when viewing your agent.

---

## POST /agent/[agent_id]/run

Execute an agent workflow on one or more uploaded videos.

### Request
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.mosaic.so/agent/[agent_id]/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_ids": ["550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"],
    "callback_url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/mosaic"
  }'
```

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| video_ids | string[] | âœ… | Array of video IDs to process |
| callback_url | string | | Optional webhook URL for status updates |

### Response
```json
{
  "run_id": "7f8d9c2b-4a6e-8b3f-1d5c-9e2f3a4b5c6d"
}
```

The `run_id` is used to track the progress of your agent run.

---

## GET /agent_run/[run_id]

Poll this endpoint to check the status of your agent run and retrieve outputs.

### Request
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.mosaic.so/agent_run/[run_id]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key"
```

### Response
```json
{
  "agent_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-789012345678",
  "started_at": "2025-01-10T14:30:00Z",
  "status": "completed",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "video_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-inputs/...",
      "thumbnail_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-inputs/..."
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-outputs/...",
      "thumbnail_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-thumbnails/...",
      "completed_at": "2025-01-10T14:35:30Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Status Values

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| running | Agent is processing your videos |
| completed | Processing finished successfully |
| failed | An error occurred during processing |

---

## Webhook Callbacks

If you provide a `callback_url` when running an agent, Mosaic will send POST requests to notify you of status changes.

### Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "flag": "RUN_FINISHED",
  "agent_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-789012345678",
  "run_id": "7f8d9c2b-4a6e-8b3f-1d5c-9e2f3a4b5c6d",
  "status": "completed",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "video_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-inputs/...",
      "thumbnail_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-inputs/..."
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-outputs/...",
      "thumbnail_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-thumbnails/..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Event Flags

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RUN_STARTED | Sent when the agent begins processing |
| OUTPUT_FINISHED | Sent when an individual output is completed |
| RUN_FINISHED | Sent when processing completes (success or failure) |

<Note>
For agent runs triggered by external events (e.g., YouTube uploads), the webhook payload will include an additional `triggered_by` field. See [Triggers](/overview/triggers) for details.

## Complete Example

Here's a complete workflow from video upload to agent processing:

```python
import requests
import time

API_KEY = "mk_your_api_key"
BASE_URL = "https://api.mosaic.so"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}

# Step 1: Get upload URL
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/videos/get_upload_url", headers=headers)
upload_data = response.json()

# Step 2: Upload video
with open("my-video.mp4", "rb") as video_file:
    requests.put(upload_data["upload_url"], data=video_file, 
                headers={"Content-Type": "video/mp4"})

# Step 3: Finalize upload
requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/videos/finalize_upload", 
             headers={**headers, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
             json={"video_id": upload_data["video_id"]})

# Step 4: Run agent
agent_id = "{agent_id}"
run_response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/agent/{agent_id}/run",
    headers={**headers, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"video_ids": [upload_data["video_id"]]}
)
run_id = run_response.json()["run_id"]

# Step 5: Poll for status
while True:
    status_response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/agent_run/{run_id}", headers=headers)
    status_data = status_response.json()
    
    if status_data["status"] in ["completed", "failed"]:
        print(f"Agent run {status_data['status']}")
        if status_data["status"] == "completed":
            for output in status_data["outputs"]:
                print(f"Output video: {output['video_url']}")
        break
    
    time.sleep(5)  # Poll every 5 seconds
```

## Best Practices

1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple videos in a single agent run for efficiency
2. **Webhooks vs Polling**: Use webhooks for production systems to avoid unnecessary API calls
3. **Error Handling**: Always handle the `failed` status and implement retry logic
4. **Agent Selection**: Choose the right agent for your use case - visit the dashboard to explore available agents

## Next Steps

- [Set up triggers](/overview/triggers) to automatically run agents on new videos
- [Configure webhooks](/overview/webhooks) for real-time notifications
