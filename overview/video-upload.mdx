Mosaic uses a streamlined 3-step process for video uploads, allowing you to upload directly to cloud storage using pre-signed URLs.

## Upload Process Overview

1. **Get an upload URL** - Request a pre-signed URL from the API
2. **Upload your video** - Send your video directly to the upload URL
3. **Finalize the upload** - Confirm the upload and optionally organize into folders

---

## Step 1: GET /videos/get_upload_url

Request a pre-signed URL for uploading your video.

### Request
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.mosaic.so/videos/get_upload_url" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key"
```

### Response
```json
{
  "video_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "upload_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mosaic-uploads/..."
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| video_id | string | Unique identifier for your video |
| upload_url | string | Pre-signed URL for uploading (expires in 1 hour) |

---

## Step 2: Upload to the URL

Upload your video file directly to the provided `upload_url` using a PUT request.

```bash
curl -X PUT "$UPLOAD_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: video/mp4" \
  --data-binary @your-video.mp4
```

<Note>
**Important**: 
- The upload URL expires after 1 hour
- Set the correct `Content-Type` header matching your video format
</Note>

---

## Step 3: POST /videos/finalize_upload

Finalize the upload to make your video available for processing.

### Request
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.mosaic.so/videos/finalize_upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "folder_path": "marketing/campaigns/2025"
  }'
```

### Request Body
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| video_id | string | âœ… | The video ID from step 1 |
| folder_path | string | | Optional folder path for organization |

### Response
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example using bash:

```bash
# Step 1: Get upload URL
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X GET "https://api.mosaic.so/videos/get_upload_url" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSAIC_API_KEY")

VIDEO_ID=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.video_id')
UPLOAD_URL=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.upload_url')

# Step 2: Upload video
curl -X PUT "$UPLOAD_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: video/mp4" \
  --data-binary @my-video.mp4

# Step 3: Finalize upload
curl -X POST "https://api.mosaic.so/videos/finalize_upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSAIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"video_id\": \"$VIDEO_ID\"}"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always check the response status before proceeding to the next step
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for network failures
3. **Progress Tracking**: For large files, consider implementing upload progress monitoring
4. **Folder Organization**: Use the `folder_path` parameter to keep your videos organized
