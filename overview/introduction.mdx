<Warning>
**⚠️ PREVIEW DOCUMENTATION**

This documentation describes the **new Mosaic API architecture** that will be deployed soon. These endpoints are not yet available in production.
</Warning>

## Overview

Mosaic's REST API allows you to kick off professional-grade video editing workflows ("Agents") entirely from code. An agent is a pre-built graph of AI and rendering nodes that can do anything from audio enhancement to animated captions – you supply a video and optional parameters, Mosaic returns a polished result.

### Typical flow

1. **Upload a video** – Get a signed URL and upload the bytes (`/videos/get_upload_url`, `/videos/finalize_upload`).
2. **Run an agent** – Call `/agent/[agent_id]/run` with the video IDs.
3. **Track progress** – Poll `/agent_run/[run_id]` or subscribe to a webhook.
4. **Download outputs** – The outputs are included in the agent run status response.

Explore each endpoint category in the sections below.

## Authentication

Use an API key **prefixed `mk_`** for all API endpoints.

```bash
# Bearer header (recommended)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.usemosaic.ai/agent/[agent_id]/run

# X-API-Key header (alternative)
curl -H "X-API-Key: mk_your_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.usemosaic.ai/agent/[agent_id]/run
```

API keys can be created and managed in your [Mosaic dashboard](https://app.usemosaic.ai).

### Webhook Authentication

Webhook requests from Mosaic include an `X-Webhook-Secret` header for verification. Always validate this secret before processing webhook payloads. See the [Webhooks](/overview/webhooks) documentation for details.



## Error Handling

Responses use conventional HTTP status codes. On errors the body contains a machine-readable `error` field plus a human friendly `detail`.

```json
{
  "detail": "Request failed",
  "error": "request_error"
}
```

| Status | Error Code | Typical Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | validation_error | Malformed JSON or missing field |
| 401 | invalid_api_key | Key revoked / wrong value |
| 403 | forbidden | Access denied / insufficient permissions |
| 404 | not_found | Unknown ID |
| 422 | parameter_out_of_range | Field outside validation bounds |
| 429 | rate_limit | Too many requests |
| 500 | internal_server_error | Unexpected exception |
